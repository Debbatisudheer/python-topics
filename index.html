    <h1>Variables: The Ingredients of Biryani</h1>
    <p>â€¢ Variables are like a labeled container or storage location that holds data, acting as placeholders for data, making it easier to work with and manipulate information within our code.</p>
    <p>In programming, variables are like ingredients in a biryani recipe. Each variable is a container that holds a specific piece of information, just like each ingredient in biryani contributes to the overall dish. You can think of variables as labels that you stick onto different pieces of data so you can refer to them later. Just as you can adjust the amount of each ingredient in a recipe, you can change the value stored in a variable as needed while your program runs. Overall, variables help you store, manage, and manipulate data in your code, much like ingredients help you create a delicious biryani dish.</p>
  <p>Overall, variables are fundamental to programming in Python (and most other programming languages) because they provide a way to store, manipulate, and work with data effectively.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
  <h1>Imagine you're cooking biryani, a delicious dish with different ingredients. Each ingredient represents a variable in your program.</h1>

  <h2>Ingredients as Variables:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In biryani, you have rice, meat, spices, vegetables, and more. Similarly, in programming, you have variables like rice, meat, spices, and vegetables.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Preparation:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Before cooking, you gather all your ingredients and prepare them. Similarly, in programming, you create variables and assign them values. For example:</li>
  </ul>
  <pre><code>rice = 2  # cups of rice
meat = "chicken"  # type of meat
spices = ["cumin", "coriander", "turmeric"]  # list of spices
vegetables = ("onion", "tomato", "potato")  # tuple of vegetables</code></pre>

  <h2>Mixing:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You mix all the ingredients together to make biryani. Similarly, in programming, you use variables together to perform tasks or calculations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Taste and Adjust:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You taste the biryani as it cooks and adjust the seasoning if needed. Similarly, in programming, you can change the values of variables as your program runs based on certain conditions or user input.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Serving:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Finally, you serve the delicious biryani to enjoy. Similarly, in programming, you use the results of your calculations or operations performed with variables to achieve your program's goals.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So, just like cooking biryani involves gathering ingredients, preparing them, mixing, adjusting, and serving, working with variables in programming involves storing data, manipulating it, and using it to achieve desired outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <h1>Variable Declaration</h1>
  <p>simple assign a value to it using the assignment operator</p>
  <p>So, in Python, creating a variable is as simple as choosing a name and giving it a value. You don't have to worry about declaring its type explicitly because Python takes care of that for you. This makes Python code more concise and flexible.</p>

  <p>Let's use the biryani analogy to explain variable declaration in Python:</p>

  <h2>Ingredients Preparation:</h2>
  <p>Imagine you're preparing to cook biryani, and you need different ingredients for your recipe. Each ingredient represents a variable, and you're about to assign values to these variables.</p>

  <h2>Assigning Ingredients:</h2>
  <p>You start assigning values (ingredients) to each variable. For example:</p>
  <pre><code>rice = 2  # cups of rice
meat = "chicken"  # type of meat
spices = ["cumin", "coriander", "turmeric"]  # list of spices
vegetables = ("onion", "tomato", "potato")  # tuple of vegetables</code></pre>

  <h2>Dynamic Nature:</h2>
  <p>Just as you don't need to declare the type of ingredient explicitly when you put it into your biryani, in Python, you don't need to declare the type of variable explicitly. Python figures it out based on the value assigned to it.</p>

  <p>So, in the biryani analogy, declaring variables in Python is like preparing your ingredients before cooking. You gather them and assign each one its value, and Python dynamically adjusts to the type of value you provide.</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <h1>Variable Naming</h1>
  <p>Variable names should follow certain rules like starting with a letter or underscore, can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with a number. It's recommended to use descriptive names to improve code readability.</p>

  <p>Let's use an analogy involving labeling ingredients for a cooking session:</p>

  <h2>Start with a Letter or Underscore:</h2>
  <p>Just like each ingredient label must start with a letter or underscore (like "salt" or "_sugar"), variable names in Python must also start with a letter or underscore.</p>

  <h2>Contain Letters, Numbers, and Underscores:</h2>
  <p>The labels on ingredients can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (like "cumin_powder" or "tomato_1"). Similarly, variable names in Python can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, allowing you to create descriptive names like "user_age" or "total_items".</p>

  <h2>Cannot Start with a Number:</h2>
  <p>Ingredients labels can't start with a number (like "2_cups_flour"). Similarly, variable names in Python cannot start with a number. For example, "2_cups" would not be a valid variable name.</p>

  <h2>Descriptive Names:</h2>
  <p>It's recommended to use descriptive names for ingredients so that everyone knows what they are (like "chopped_onions" instead of just "onions"). Similarly, in Python, using descriptive variable names improves code readability and makes it easier for others (or your future self!) to understand what the variable represents.</p>

  <p>So, just as labeling ingredients with descriptive names and following certain rules ensures everyone knows what they are, naming variables in Python with descriptive names and following the rules ensures your code is clear and understandable to others.</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <h1>Variable Types</h1>
  <p>Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, etc. Understanding these types and how they behave is essential. Additionally, Python also allows complex data structures like lists of lists or dictionaries of lists.</p>

  <p>Let's use the biryani analogy to explain variable types and data structures in Python:</p>

  <h2>Integer (int):</h2>
  <p>Imagine you're cooking biryani, and you need to decide how many servings you want to make. The number of servings is like an integer because it's a whole number:</p>
  <pre><code>servings = 5</code></pre>

  <h2>Float:</h2>
  <p>Now, suppose you're measuring the amount of water needed to cook the biryani. The amount might not always be a whole number; it could be a decimal, making it a float:</p>
  <pre><code>water_needed = 2.5  # liters</code></pre>

  <h2>String (str):</h2>
  <p>Next, you're preparing the ingredients, and one of them is chicken. "Chicken" is a piece of text or a string:</p>
  <pre><code>ingredient = "chicken"</code></pre>

  <h2>List:</h2>
  <p>As you gather ingredients, you might have a list of spices you need to add to the biryani. Just like listing ingredients, you can create a list of spices in Python:</p>
  <pre><code>spices_list = ["cumin", "coriander", "turmeric"]</code></pre>

  <h2>Tuple:</h2>
  <p>Sometimes you might want to pair ingredients together, like a tuple of vegetables you're going to add:</p>
  <pre><code>vegetables_tuple = ("onion", "tomato", "potato")</code></pre>

  <h2>Dictionary:</h2>
  <p>You might also need to organize ingredients by category, like having a dictionary where each key represents a category and the corresponding value is a list of ingredients:</p>
  <pre><code>ingredient_categories = {"spices": ["cumin", "coriander", "turmeric"], "vegetables": ["onion", "tomato", "potato"]}</code></pre>

  <h2>Set:</h2>
  <p>Lastly, you want to ensure you don't add duplicate spices to your biryani. A set can help you with that:</p>
  <pre><code>unique_spices = {"cumin", "coriander", "turmeric"}</code></pre>

  <p>Just as you carefully select and organize ingredients to cook a delicious biryani, you can use different variable types and data structures in Python to store and manage data effectively in your programs.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
  <p>Let's create a biryani analogy for variable scope:</p>

  <p>Imagine you're cooking biryani in a kitchen, and you have different areas within the kitchen representing different scopes in Python.</p>

  <h2>Global Scope (Kitchen):</h2>
  <p>The kitchen represents the global scope in Python. Here, you have essential ingredients like rice, meat, spices, and utensils placed on the kitchen counter. These ingredients and utensils are available throughout the kitchen and are like global variables in Python.</p>

  <h2>Local Scope (Cooking Stations):</h2>
  <p>Now, let's say you have different cooking stations within the kitchen, each specializing in a specific task, like chopping vegetables, marinating meat, and cooking rice. At each station, you have ingredients and tools specific to that task. These ingredients and tools are like local variables in Python, accessible only within the scope of that cooking station.</p>

  <h2>Scope Resolution (Moving Between Cooking Stations):</h2>
  <p>If you need an ingredient or tool not available at your current cooking station, you'll have to move to another station or the kitchen counter to get it. Similarly, in Python, if a function needs a variable not available locally, Python will look for it in the global scope.</p>

  <p>So, cooking biryani is like working with variable scope in Python. Just as you have different areas within the kitchen for different cooking tasks, Python has different scopes for organizing variables, and Python knows where to find variables based on their scope, much like you know where to find ingredients and tools in different areas of the kitchen while cooking biryani.</p>
 <h1>Python Code Example: Variable Scope</h1>
  <pre><code class="python"># Global scope (kitchen)
rice = "2 cups of rice"
meat = "chicken"
spices = ["cumin", "coriander", "turmeric"]

# Local scope (cooking stations)
def chop_vegetables():
    vegetables = ["onion", "tomato", "potato"]
    print("Chopping vegetables:", vegetables)

def marinate_meat():
    print("Marinating meat:", meat)

def cook_rice():
    print("Cooking rice:", rice)

# Main function (cooking biryani)
def cook_biryani():
    # Accessing global variables
    print("Ingredients for biryani:")
    print("- Rice:", rice)
    print("- Meat:", meat)
    print("- Spices:", spices)

    # Calling functions representing cooking stations
    chop_vegetables()
    marinate_meat()
    cook_rice()

# Calling the main function to cook biryani
cook_biryani()</code></pre>

  <p>In this code:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We have global variables (rice, meat, and spices) representing ingredients placed on the kitchen counter.</li>
    <li>We have functions (chop_vegetables, marinate_meat, and cook_rice) representing different cooking stations within the kitchen, each with its own set of local variables (vegetables).</li>
    <li>The main function (cook_biryani) represents the process of cooking biryani, where we access global variables and call functions to perform different cooking tasks.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Running this code will simulate the process of cooking biryani in a kitchen, helping you understand variable scope in Python better through the analogy.</p>

</div>
<div class="container">
  <h1>Immutable vs Mutable Types</h1>
  <p>Some data types like integers, floats, strings, and tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created. Others like lists and dictionaries are mutable, meaning their values can be modified.</p>

  <p>Let's use the analogy of making biryani to explain the difference between immutable and mutable types in Python:</p>

  <h2>Immutable Types (Prepared Ingredients):</h2>
  <p>Think of immutable types as ingredients that you've already prepared for making biryani. Once you've chopped vegetables, measured spices, or marinated meat, you can't change their properties. They're ready to be used in your recipe, but you can't alter them directly. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chopped Vegetables: Once you've chopped onions, tomatoes, and potatoes, you can't change their size or composition.</li>
    <li>Measured Spices: If you've measured out cumin, coriander, and turmeric, you can't change the quantity of these spices.</li>
    <li>Marinated Meat: Once you've marinated chicken with yogurt and spices, you can't remove or alter the marinade.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mutable Types (Ingredients Yet to be Prepared):</h2>
  <p>Now, think of mutable types as ingredients that you're still preparing or can modify while cooking. These ingredients can be chopped, mixed, or adjusted according to your taste. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Raw Vegetables: Before chopping, vegetables like onions, tomatoes, and potatoes can be sliced, diced, or minced according to your preference.</li>
    <li>Whole Spices: Before adding them to the dish, whole spices like cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon can be crushed, ground, or left whole based on your recipe.</li>
    <li>Uncooked Meat: Before marinating, meat like chicken or mutton can be cut into different sizes or pieces, depending on your cooking method.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this analogy, immutable types are like prepared ingredients that you can't change once they're ready, while mutable types are like ingredients that you're still preparing or can adjust as you cook. This difference mirrors how immutable and mutable types behave in Python, where immutable types can't be modified after creation, while mutable types can be changed.</p>

  <h2>Python Code Example:</h2>
  <pre><code class="python"># Immutable types (prepared ingredients)
chopped_vegetables = ["onion", "tomato", "potato"]
measured_spices = {"cumin": "1 tsp", "coriander": "1 tsp", "turmeric": "1/2 tsp"}
marinated_meat = ("chicken", "yogurt", "spices")

print("Before cooking:")
print("Chopped Vegetables:", chopped_vegetables)
print("Measured Spices:", measured_spices)
print("Marinated Meat:", marinated_meat)

# Mutable types (ingredients yet to be prepared)
raw_vegetables = ["onion", "tomato", "potato"]
whole_spices = ["cardamom", "cloves", "cinnamon"]
uncooked_meat = ["chicken", "mutton", "beef"]

print("\nDuring cooking:")
# Adding a new vegetable
raw_vegetables.append("carrot")

# Removing a spice
whole_spices.remove("cloves")

# Changing the type of meat
uncooked_meat[0] = "chicken thighs"

# Displaying mutable types
print("Raw Vegetables:", raw_vegetables)
print("Whole Spices:", whole_spices)
print("Uncooked Meat:", uncooked_meat)

# Demonstrating immutability
# This will raise an error because tuples are immutable
# marinated_meat[0] = "fish"</code></pre>

  <p>The provided Python code example demonstrates how immutable and mutable types behave in Python, using the biryani analogy.</p>

  <p>This code:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Initializes immutable types (<code>chopped_vegetables</code>, <code>measured_spices</code>, <code>marinated_meat</code>) representing prepared ingredients.</li>
    <li>Initializes mutable types (<code>raw_vegetables</code>, <code>whole_spices</code>, <code>uncooked_meat</code>) representing ingredients yet to be prepared.</li>
    <li>Simulates cooking by modifying mutable types to add, remove, or change ingredients.</li>
    <li>Attempts to modify an immutable type (<code>marinated_meat</code>), demonstrating immutability.</li>
  </ul>
    <h2>Output:</h2>
    <p>Before cooking:</p>
    <p>Chopped Vegetables: ['onion', 'tomato', 'potato']</p>
    <p>Measured Spices: {'cumin': '1 tsp', 'coriander': '1 tsp', 'turmeric': '1/2 tsp'}</p>
    <p>Marinated Meat: ('chicken', 'yogurt', 'spices')</p>

    <p>During cooking:</p>
    <p>Raw Vegetables: ['onion', 'tomato', 'potato', 'carrot']</p>
    <p>Whole Spices: ['cardamom', 'cinnamon']</p>
    <p>Uncooked Meat: ['chicken thighs', 'mutton', 'beef']</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h1>Variable Assignment and Reassignment:</h1>
  <p>Variables can be assigned and reassigned with different values throughout the program's execution. Let's use the biryani-making analogy to explain variable assignment and reassignment:</p>

  <h2>Initial Preparation:</h2>
  <p>Imagine you're gathering ingredients to make biryani. Initially, you assign values to your variables based on the ingredients you have:</p>
  <pre><code class="python">rice = "2 cups"
meat = "chicken"
spices = ["cumin", "coriander", "turmeric"]</code></pre>

  <h2>Cooking Process Begins:</h2>
  <p>As you start cooking, you realize you need more rice, so you reassign the rice variable:</p>
  <pre><code class="python">rice = "3 cups"</code></pre>

  <p>Changing Plans: Then, you decide to use lamb instead of chicken, so you reassign the meat variable:</p>
  <pre><code class="python">meat = "lamb"</code></pre>

  <p>Adding Ingredients: You realize you forgot to include cloves in your spice mix, so you add it to the spices list:</p>
  <pre><code class="python">spices.append("cloves")</code></pre>

  <p>Adjusting Quantities: While cooking, you realize you need less coriander, so you modify the second item in the spices list:</p>
  <pre><code class="python">spices[1] = "less coriander"</code></pre>

  <p>Finalizing: After adjusting and adding ingredients, you proceed with cooking your biryani.</p>

  <h2>Python Code Example:</h2>
  <pre><code class="python"># Initial variable assignment
rice = "2 cups"
meat = "chicken"
spices = ["cumin", "coriander", "turmeric"]

# Display initial ingredients
print("Initial Ingredients:")
print("Rice:", rice)
print("Meat:", meat)
print("Spices:", spices)

# Reassigning variables during cooking
rice = "3 cups"
meat = "lamb"
spices.append("cloves")
spices[1] = "less coriander"

# Display final ingredients after adjustments
print("\nFinal Ingredients after Adjustments:")
print("Rice:", rice)
print("Meat:", meat)
print("Spices:", spices)</code></pre>

  <h2>Output:</h2>
  <p>Initial Ingredients:</p>
  <p>Rice: 2 cups</p>
  <p>Meat: chicken</p>
  <p>Spices: ['cumin', 'coriander', 'turmeric']</p>

  <p>Final Ingredients after Adjustments:</p>
  <p>Rice: 3 cups</p>
  <p>Meat: lamb</p>
  <p>Spices: ['cumin', 'less coriander', 'turmeric', 'cloves']</p>
   <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Initialize variables representing initial ingredients for making biryani (rice, meat, spices).</li>
    <li>Display the initial ingredients.</li>
    <li>Reassign variables during the cooking process to reflect changes, such as adding more rice, changing the type of meat, adding cloves to the spice mix, and reducing the quantity of coriander.</li>
    <li>Display the final ingredients after adjustments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Output:</h2>
  <pre><code class="python">
    Initial Ingredients:
    Rice: 2 cups
    Meat: chicken
    Spices: ['cumin', 'coriander', 'turmeric']

    Final Ingredients after Adjustments:
    Rice: 3 cups
    Meat: lamb
    Spices: ['cumin', 'less coriander', 'turmeric', 'cloves']
  </code></pre>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <h1>Memory Management:</h1>
  <p>Understanding how Python manages memory for variables, especially mutable types, is important to write efficient code. Let's use the biryani-making analogy to explain memory management in Python:</p>

  <h2>Immutable Ingredients (Prepared Ingredients):</h2>
  <p>Imagine you have some pre-measured spices and chopped vegetables ready for making biryani. Once these ingredients are prepared, you can't change them. They stay the same throughout the cooking process. Similarly, in Python, immutable types like integers, floats, and strings are like these prepared ingredients. Once you create them, their values cannot be changed.</p>

  <h2>Mutable Ingredients (Raw Ingredients):</h2>
  <p>Now, imagine you have a bag of rice and some whole spices that you're going to use for making biryani. You can add more rice to the bag, remove some spices, or even change the type of meat you're using. These ingredients are flexible and can be modified as needed. In Python, mutable types like lists and dictionaries are like these raw ingredients. You can add, remove, or modify their contents.</p>

  <h2>Memory Management:</h2>
  <p>In your kitchen, you have limited space to store ingredients. Similarly, in Python, your computer has limited memory to store data. When you create variables and assign values to them, Python allocates memory to store those values. For immutable types, Python allocates memory once, and the values stay there unchanged. For mutable types, Python allocates memory initially, but if you modify the contents of the variable, Python may need to allocate additional memory to accommodate the changes.</p>

  <h2>Cleaning Up Unused Ingredients:</h2>
  <p>Once you've finished cooking and serving biryani, you clean up your kitchen by putting away unused ingredients. Similarly, in Python, when a variable is no longer needed or goes out of scope, Python automatically deallocates the memory used by that variable. This process is like cleaning up your kitchen after cooking, ensuring that you're not wasting space by keeping unused ingredients lying around.</p>

  <p>Understanding memory management in Python, using the biryani-making analogy, helps you grasp how Python handles memory for variables, especially when dealing with mutable types, ensuring efficient use of resources and preventing memory-related issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <h1>Variable Interpolation and Concatenation:</h1>
  <p>Python provides various ways to format strings with variables, including concatenation, %-formatting, str.format(), and f-strings. Let's use the biryani-making analogy to explain variable interpolation and concatenation:</p>

  <h2>Concatenation (Mixing Ingredients):</h2>
  <p>Imagine you're mixing ingredients together in a bowl to make biryani. Concatenation in Python is like mixing different ingredients together to form a single string. You take individual pieces of information (variables) and combine them using the + operator to create a new string.</p>

  <h2>%-Formatting (Labeling Ingredients):</h2>
  <p>Imagine you're labeling containers with ingredients for making biryani. %-formatting in Python is like labeling variables within a string template using % placeholders. You define a string template with placeholders for variables, and then use the % operator to replace placeholders with actual values.</p>

  <h2>str.format() (Recipe Instructions):</h2>
  <p>Imagine you're writing down step-by-step instructions for making biryani. str.format() in Python is like writing down a recipe with placeholders for ingredients. You define a string template with curly braces {} as placeholders for variables, and then use the .format() method to replace placeholders with actual values.</p>

  <h2>f-strings (Modern Recipe Cards):</h2>
  <p>Imagine you're using modern recipe cards with dynamic information. f-strings in Python are like modern recipe cards where you can directly insert variables into a string using curly braces {}.</p>

  <p>Each of these methods allows you to dynamically include variable values within a string, just like mixing ingredients or labeling containers while making biryani. Choose the method that best suits your preference and coding style.</p>

  <h2>Code:</h2>
  <pre><code># Variables representing ingredients
  rice = "2 cups"
  meat = "chicken"
  spices = "cumin, coriander, turmeric"

  # Concatenation
  recipe_concatenated = "For making biryani, you need: " + rice + " of rice, " + meat + " as the main ingredient, and spices like " + spices + "."

  # %-formatting
  recipe_percent = "For making biryani, you need: %s of rice, %s as the main ingredient, and spices like %s." % (rice, meat, spices)

  # str.format()
  recipe_format = "For making biryani, you need: {} of rice, {} as the main ingredient, and spices like {}.".format(rice, meat, spices)

  # f-strings
  recipe_f_string = f"For making biryani, you need: {rice} of rice, {meat} as the main ingredient, and spices like {spices}."

  # Printing the recipes
  print("Concatenation:", recipe_concatenated)
  print("Percentage Formatting:", recipe_percent)
  print("str.format():", recipe_format)
  print("f-strings:", recipe_f_string)
  </code></pre>
    <h2>Output:</h2>
  <p>Concatenation: For making biryani, you need: 2 cups of rice, chicken as the main ingredient, and spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric.</p>
  <p>Percentage Formatting: For making biryani, you need: 2 cups of rice, chicken as the main ingredient, and spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric.</p>
  <p>str.format(): For making biryani, you need: 2 cups of rice, chicken as the main ingredient, and spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric.</p>
  <p>f-strings: For making biryani, you need: 2 cups of rice, chicken as the main ingredient, and spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric.</p>
</div>
 <div class="container">
    <h1>Illustrating Type Conversion Using Biryani Analogy:</h1>
    <p><strong>Ingredient Measurement Conversion:</strong> Imagine you have a recipe that calls for 2 cups of rice, but you only have a measurement in kilograms. To use the recipe, you need to convert the kilograms to cups. Similarly, in Python, you might have a variable representing a number as a string, but you need to convert it to an integer or float for mathematical operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredient Substitution:</strong> Imagine your recipe calls for chicken, but you want to make a vegetarian version using tofu instead. You need to substitute the meat ingredient with tofu. Similarly, in Python, you might need to convert a variable from one data type to another to use it in a different context.</p>
    <p><strong>Flexible Cooking Methods:</strong> Imagine your recipe book provides instructions for cooking biryani on a stove, but you want to use a pressure cooker instead. You need to adapt the cooking method to fit your equipment. Similarly, in Python, type conversion allows you to adapt variables to different contexts or operations.</p>
   <p>In Python, you can perform type conversion using built-in functions like <code>int()</code>, <code>float()</code>, <code>str()</code>, etc. These functions allow you to convert variables from one type to another as needed, enabling flexibility and adaptability in your code, just like adapting ingredients and cooking methods while making biryani.</p>

    <h2>Python Code Example:</h2>
    <pre><code>
        # Ingredient measurements
        rice_kg = "1.5"  # Representing 1.5 kilograms of rice
        meat_quantity = "3"  # Representing 3 pieces of chicken
        spice_level = "4.5"  # Representing medium spice level

        # Convert ingredient measurements to appropriate types
        rice_cups = float(rice_kg) * 4.2  # Conversion factor: 1 kg = 4.2 cups
        meat_quantity_int = int(meat_quantity)
        spice_level_float = float(spice_level)

        # Display converted ingredient measurements
        print("Converted Ingredient Measurements:")
        print("Rice (cups):", rice_cups)
        print("Meat (pieces):", meat_quantity_int)
        print("Spice Level:", spice_level_float)

        # Ingredient substitution
        meat_quantity_new = str(meat_quantity_int)  # Converting back to string for substitution
        recipe = f"For making biryani, you need: {rice_cups} cups of rice, {meat_quantity_new} pieces of tofu, and spices for a spice level of {spice_level_float}."
        print("\nUpdated Recipe with Tofu substitution:", recipe)
    </code></pre>
 <p><strong>In this code:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>We have variables representing ingredient measurements as strings (<code>rice_kg</code>, <code>meat_quantity</code>, <code>spice_level</code>).</li>
        <li>We convert these strings to appropriate types (<code>float</code> for rice, <code>int</code> for meat, <code>float</code> for spice level) using <code>float()</code>, <code>int()</code>, and store them in new variables (<code>rice_cups</code>, <code>meat_quantity_int</code>, <code>spice_level_float</code>).</li>
        <li>We demonstrate ingredient substitution by converting the integer <code>meat_quantity_int</code> back to a string and substituting it in the recipe string using <code>f-strings</code>.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>output:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Rice (cups):</strong> 6.300000000000001</li>
    <li><strong>Meat (pieces):</strong> 3</li>
    <li><strong>Spice Level:</strong> 4.5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Updated Recipe with Tofu substitution:</strong> For making biryani, you need: 6.300000000000001 cups of rice, 3 pieces of tofu, and spices for a spice level of 4.5.</p>
